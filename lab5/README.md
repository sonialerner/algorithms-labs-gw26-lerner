# CSCI 3212 Lab 5: AVL Tree Deletion and Rebalancing

In this lab, you will extend your AVL tree implementation from Lab 4 by implementing
deletion with post-deletion rebalancing. You will trace and implement AVL deletion,
analyze why deletions require more complex rebalancing than insertions, and
empirically compare insertion and deletion cost.

This lab reuses the pointer-based linked AVL trees and rotation infrastructure
from Lab 4. Deletion follows the same three BST deletion cases (0, 1, 2 children),
then rebalances every ancestor of the deleted node on the way up toward the root.
Unlike insertion, a single deletion can trigger **multiple independent rotations**
at different ancestors.

## Part 1: AVL Deletion Strategy

### Why deletion is harder than insertion

In Lab 4, AVL insertion was structured as: **insert → walk ancestors up → fix at most one violation**.
A single insertion creates a single "problem zone" (the inserted key's ancestors),
and one rotation fixes the entire subtree.

AVL deletion is fundamentally different:

1. **Multiple violation zones:** Deleting a node can cause imbalances at multiple
   ancestors simultaneously.
2. **Cascading rebalancing:** After fixing an imbalance at ancestor $z$ with a rotation,
   the rotated subtree may have a different height than before. This can cause a new
   imbalance higher up.
3. **Propagate further:** Unlike insertion (which stops after one rotation), deletion
   must check every ancestor all the way to the root. After each rotation, the
   rebalancing loop continues.

**Key insight:** An insertion at height $h$ changes the subtree's height by at most 1
locally, stopping rebalancing immediately. A deletion can propagate height changes
all the way to the root.

### Post-deletion rebalancing strategy

```text
AVL-DELETE(T, key)
  z = BST-DELETE(T, key)          // Perform BST deletion; z is the deleted node (or None)
  current = parent_of_deleted     // Start rebalancing from the parent of the deleted node
  while current != None
    UPDATE-HEIGHT(current)        // Recompute height after structural change
    bf = BALANCE-FACTOR(current)
    if |bf| >= 2                  // Imbalance detected
      // Determine which case (LL, RR, LR, RL) and rotate
      // Unlike insertion, the key is NOT available—use bf signs instead
      if bf > 1                   // Left-heavy
        if BALANCE-FACTOR(current.left) >= 0
          ROTATE-RIGHT(T, current)          // LL
          current = current.parent          // Move up after rotation
        else
          ROTATE-LEFT-RIGHT(T, current)     // LR
          current = current.parent          // Move up after rotation
      else if bf < -1             // Right-heavy
        if BALANCE-FACTOR(current.right) <= 0
          ROTATE-LEFT(T, current)           // RR
          current = current.parent          // Move up after rotation
        else
          ROTATE-RIGHT-LEFT(T, current)     // RL
          current = current.parent          // Move up after rotation
    current = current.parent      // Continue to next ancestor
  return z
```

**Critical difference from insertion:** After a rotation in insertion, the rebalancing
stops immediately. In deletion, we must continue up the tree. The rotated subtree may
have a different height, creating imbalances higher up.

### 1.1 Short answer: BST deletion reminder

**TODO 1.1:** Briefly recall the three deletion cases from Lab 3/4:
- What happens when the target node has 0 children?

Simply delete the node.

- What happens when the target node has 1 child?

Simply replace the target node with its child

- What happens when the target node has 2 children, and why is the in-order successor used?

Replace the target node with its in-order successor since we know its the node that is immediately larger than the target node.

### 1.2 Short answer: Height change after deletion

**TODO 1.2:** When you delete a leaf node from an AVL tree:
- Does the leaf's parent's height change? By how much?

The parent's height changes iff the leaf was the parent's only child. In that case, the height would be reduced by 1. 

- Can the grandparent's height change?

The grandparent's height changes iff the leaf was the tallest in the subtree. In that case, the height would be reduced by 1.

- Can the imbalance propagate to the root?

Yes.

## Part 2: AVL Deletion Traces

### Example: AVL trees for deletion traces

For the traces below, we use AVL trees built carefully so that deletions trigger imbalances.

### 2.1 Trace: Single rotation after deletion

Start with this AVL tree:
```
      30
     /  \
    20   40
   /
  10
```
(All nodes balanced: 30 has BF=1, 20 has BF=1, others BF=0.)

**TODO 2.1:** Delete key `40` from this tree. Trace the rebalancing:

1. Perform BST deletion of 40 (it's a leaf). What is the tree after deletion?

```
       30  
      /  
    20
   /   
  10 
```

2. Rebalance from the parent of the deleted node (30).

```
    20
   /  \ 
  10  30
```

3. What is the balance factor at 30?

0

4. Identify the violation signature (LL, RR, LR, or RL) and the required rotation.

LL -> right rotate

5. After rotation, is the tree still imbalanced? If so, continue rebalancing.

The tree is balanced.

6. Draw the final tree and record the in-order traversal.

```
    20
   /  \ 
  10  30
```

In-order traversal: `10, 20, 30`

| Step | Action | Tree state | Unbalanced node | BF | Signature | Rotation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Delete 40 | 40 is removed (leaf) | - | - | - | - | Tree now has 30 root, 20 left, nothing right |
| 2 | Rebalance from 30 | - | 10 | 2 | LL | R | - |
| 3 | After rotation | - | - | 0 | - | - | Final state |

### 2.2 Trace: Double rotation after deletion

Start with this AVL tree:
```
      30
     /  \
   10    40
    \
    20
```
(All nodes balanced: 30 has BF=0, 10 has BF=-1, others BF=0.)

**TODO 2.2:** Delete key `40` from this tree. Trace the rebalancing:

1. Perform BST deletion of 40 (it's a leaf).

```
      30
     /  
   10    
    \
    20
```

2. Rebalance from the parent of the deleted node (30).

Step 1:

```
      30
     /  
   20    
    \
    10
```
Step 2:
```
      20
     /  \
   10    30 
   
```

3. What is the balance factor at 30 after 40 is deleted?

0

4. Identify the violation signature. Is node 10 left-heavy or right-heavy?

10 is right heavy

5. Which rotation(s) are needed (single or double)?

LR case -> Left rotation followed by right rotation

6. Draw the final tree and record the in-order traversal.

```
      20
     /  \
   10    30 
   
```

In-order traversal: `10, 20, 30` 

| Step | Action | Current node | BF before | Signature | Rotation applied | BF after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Delete 40 | 30 | 2 | LR | L then R | 0 |
| 2 | Verify final | - | - | - | - | - |

### 2.3 Trace: Two-child deletion with rebalancing

Start with this AVL tree:
```
        50
       /  \
      30   70
     / \     \
   20  40    80
   /
  10
```
(All balanced initially.)

**TODO 2.3:** Delete key `30`. This is a 2-child deletion (has both 20 and 40 as children).
Trace the rebalancing:

1. Find the in-order successor of 30 (minimum of right subtree: 40).

`40`

2. Perform the transplant: replace 30 with 40, move 40's children appropriately.

```
        50
       /  \
      40   70
     /      \
    20       80
   /
  10
```

3. Rebalance from the appropriate starting node (the parent of where 40 was removed).

```
        50
       /  \
      20   70
     /  \    \
   10   40    80
```

4. At each step, identify any violation and apply the necessary rotation.

Violation: `BF` at `40` = `-2`
\
Case: LL
\
Action: R

5. Continue until no more imbalances exist.

| Step | Current node | BF | Imbalanced? | Violation | Rotation applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 40 | 2 | Y | LL | R |
| 2 | 50 | 0 | - | - | - |

## Part 3: Implementation

Open `avl_practice.py` and implement the deletion function:

### 3.1 Implement AVL deletion

**TODO 3.1:** Complete `avl_delete(tree, key)` in `avl_practice.py`.

The skeleton is provided. Complete the rebalancing loop to:
1. Identify the parent of the deleted node to start rebalancing from.
2. Walk up from that node to the root, checking and fixing each ancestor.
3. Return the deleted node (or `None` if key not found).

Your implementation must:
- Correctly identify the rebalancing start point for all three BST deletion cases.
- Update heights and balance factors as you walk up.
- Recognize and apply the correct rotation for each violation signature (LL, RR, LR, RL).
- **Continue rebalancing at every ancestor** (unlike insertion, which stops after one rotation).

Provided helpers (already implemented):
- `transplant(tree, u, v)` - updates tree pointers
- `tree_minimum(node)` - finds minimum in subtree
- `tree_search(node, key)` - searches for key
- `balance_factor(node)` - returns BF
- `rotate_left(tree, node)`, `rotate_right(tree, node)` - single rotations
- `rotate_left_right(tree, node)`, `rotate_right_left(tree, node)` - double rotations
- `update_height(node)` - recalculates node's height

```bash
python3 avl_practice.py
```

## Part 4: Insertion vs. Deletion Comparison

Once deletion is working, the test suite runs a profiling experiment:
insert and delete 1000 random keys into an AVL tree,
measuring the number of rotations triggered by each operation.

### 4.1 Short answer: Why is deletion costlier?

**TODO 4.1:** Based on your implementation and understanding of the algorithm:

1. Why can a single deletion trigger multiple rotations at different ancestors,
   whereas a single insertion triggers at most one rotation?

A single deletion can trigger multiple rotations at different ancestors whereas a single insertion triggeres at most one rotation because ____

2. What property of rotations ensures that insertion stops after one fix?

IDK

3. Does a deletion ever need to rebalance higher than the root? Explain.

No because it is impossible to rebalance above the root.

### 4.2 Short answer: Real-world implications

**TODO 4.2:** Consider a scenario where an application frequently insertions and deletions
in an AVL tree (e.g., a priority queue or cache).

1. Based on the rotation cost, would you expect insertions or deletions to be slower?

I expect deletions to be slower because they can require multiple rotations, each of which is expensive.

2. If deletions become a bottleneck, what alternative data structure (from this course)
   might handle deletions more efficiently?

We could use a B-tree or B+tree to prevent the need to delete nodes frequently.

## Final check

Run the practice file from within the `lab5/` directory:

```bash
python3 avl_practice.py
```

- Any unfinished function reports `[TODO]`.
- Any logic error or failed assertion reports `[FAIL]`.
- Any fully working function reports `[PASS]`.

The practice file exits with a nonzero exit code if any check is unfinished or
failing. When all checks pass, the command returns exit code `0`.

The profiling output compares insertion vs. deletion rotation counts on random keys
and provides empirical evidence of why deletion is costlier.
